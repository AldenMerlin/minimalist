# minimalist

Minimalist is a framework with UI components, agnostic to frameworks, and easy to use and change identity.

This means that you can use it without any framework, or with frameworks such as angular, react, vue, etc.


## architecture

The core of each component, is a ES6 Class, and for each framework we create a respective component (directive in angular, component in react, ...). So, the core is just one, the ES6 Classs, and we move their to frameworks, respecting the architecture of each one of them.

## design

We like flat design, but minimalism is more easy to use, and overwite. And have less kbs, so we choose for a minimalist design. This means that our components has a design specification, but if you need (and you will), you can easily change the design, to follow your identity.

## productive

During development, you maybe write more than you want, for example, the following code below, just implement a input text with a text as placeholder, and validation messages to required field.

```html
<md-input-container no-ink="no-ink" class="md-icon-float md-block md-has-icon">
  <label>Username</label>
  <input required name="username" ng-model="username" name="username" autocomplete="off"/>
  <small ng-messages="form.username.$error" class="help-block">
    <span ng-message="required">Campo obrigat√≥rio</span>
  </small>
</md-input-container>
```

We abstract all stuffs in components, so our input component is just

```html
<mn-input placeholder="Username" ng-model="username" required />
<!-- and other attributes that you know like disabled, autofucus, etc, is supported, we dont reinvent the wheel -->
```

### Demo

You can see all of our components here in our site [minimalist/components](http://reservafacil.github.io/minimalist) ~~not available yet, working in that~~.

### Usage

```sh
# working in progress, not available yet
npm install @reservafacil/minimalist
```

```js
// In your scripts, just import the module, and bundle using a tool like webpack, or browserify
const {input} from '@reservafacil/minimalist'
```

```html
<!-- in your html, just use the component -->
<mn-input placeholder="lorem ipsum" />
```

Using a framework? Check the directory `sources/COMPONENT-NAME-HERE` to see entire documentation of component.


### Tests

We believe in tests as the unique way to have sure that our work really works, in different browsers and operational systems. So, we cover all with tests.

You can run all tests, cloning this project, and run

```sh
# install the dependencies
npm install
```

```sh
npm test
```

Actually we supports latest versions of chrome, firefox, and safari. We will add more browsers soon.
